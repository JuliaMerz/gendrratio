gendrratio
==========

Facebook event statistics based on the only data the API can always access. It's a pretty
simple hack, it pulls a user's FB events then investigates the one the user selects. For
that, it just looks up the event on the FB API and investigates and follows up with each user
in order to pull gender statistics. I originally wanted to gather more than just gender, and
give a more comprehensive crossection of who attends what FaceBook event, but unfortunately
privacy setting seem to be more strict when it comes to the API, so the only data I was able
to get even somewhat consistently is gender, so that's the only statistic I can provide.
